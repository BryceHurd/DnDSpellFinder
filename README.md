# DnDSpellFinder

Hello, its a simple website for getting information on a spell for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. I am using the API https://www.dnd5eapi.co/

The site still has issues. My listed item doesn't clear unless you refreash the page. The listed items appear below Subclass and Class(s).
